The MVC pattern represents the Model-View-Controller (model-view-controller) pattern. This mode is used for hierarchical development of applications.

Model-The model represents an object or JAVA POJO that accesses data. It can also have logic to update the controller when the data changes.
View-A view represents a visualization of the data contained in the model.
Controller-The controller acts on the model and view. It controls the flow of data to model objects and updates the view when the data changes. It separates the view from the model.
